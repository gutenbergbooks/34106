<h2>LITTLE WOMEN<br />
LETTERS FROM THE HOUSE<br />
OF ALCOTT</h2>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The "Really, Truly" True</span></h3>

<p class="cap">WHEN "Little Women," the play,
reopened to many readers the
pages of "Little Women," the
book, that delightful chronicle of family
life, dramatist and producer learned from
many unconscious sources the depth of
Louisa M. Alcott's human appeal. Standing
one night at the back of the theater
as the audience was dispersing, they listened
to its comments on the play.</p>

<p class="indent">"A wonderful picture of home life,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</span>
only we don't have such homes," said
a big, prosperous-looking man to his
wife, with a touch of regret in his voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," agreed his young daughter, a
tall, slender, graceful girl, as she snuggled
down cosily into her fur coat and tucked
a bunch of violets away from the touch
of the frosty night, "it is beautiful;
but, daddy, it isn't real. There never
was such a family."</p>

<p class="indent">But it is real; there was such a family,
and in letters, journals, and illustration
this little book gives the history of the
four Little Women, the Alcott girls,
whom Louisa immortalized in her greatest
story: Anna, who is Meg in "Little
Women"; Louisa, the irrepressible and
ambitious Jo; Elizabeth, the little Beth
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 3]</span>
of the book; and Abba May, the graceful
and statuesque Amy.</p>

<p class="indent">Rare influences were at work in this
ideal American home, where the intellectual
and brilliant father was gifted
in all ways except those that led to
material success, and the wise and gentle
mother combined with her loyalty and
devotion to her husband a stanch,
practical common sense, which more
than once served to guide the frail
Alcott bark through troubled seas.</p>

<p class="indent">Following her remarkable success as
a writer of short stories, Louisa M.
Alcott was asked for a book. She said
at first it was impossible, but repeated
requests from her publishers brought
from her the announcement that the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span>
only long story she could write would be
about her own family. "Little Women"
resulted, and, in erecting this House of
Delight for young and old, Louisa Alcott
builded better than she knew. Her Jo
has been the inspiration of countless
girls, and the many-sidedness of her
character is indicated by the widely
diverging lines of endeavor which Jo's
example has suggested to the girl readers
of the story.</p>

<p class="indent">In the case of the two editors, both
from early childhood found their inspiration
in Jo. One, patterning after her
idol, sought success in a stage career,
beginning to "act" before a mirror,
with a kitchen apron for a train and a
buttonhook for a dagger. The other,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>
always with a pencil in hand, first copied
Jo by writing "lurid tales" for the weekly
sensation papers, and later emerged into
Newspaper Row.</p>

<p class="indent">It was more than a year after the
success of "Little Women" as a play
had become a part of theatrical history
that they visited the scenes hallowed
by the memories of the Little Women.
They wished to see Concord together,
so they made a Sentimental Journey to
the House of Alcott.</p>

<p class="indent">The sun was shining, and the air was
crisp&mdash;just such a day as Miss Alcott
described in the Plumfield harvest home,
the last chapter in "Little Women."
They spent hours in Orchard House,
touching reverently the small personal
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span>
effects of Louisa M. Alcott, seeing the
shelf between the windows in that
little upper room, where she wrote and
dreamed. They even climbed to the
garret and wondered which window was
her favorite scribbling seat, with a tin
kitchen for her manuscripts, a pile of
apples for her refreshment, and Scrabble,
the bewhiskered rat, for her playfellow.</p>

<p class="indent">Through the woods back of Orchard
House they followed the winding pathway
to the Hall of Philosophy, half
hidden among the trees, where Bronson
Alcott had his Conversations, where
Emerson and Thoreau were often heard,
and the most intellectual debates of the
century took place.</p>

<p class="indent">At sunset they visited Sleepy Hollow,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span>
the resting place of the Alcotts, with
Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne close
by&mdash;a goodly company, neighbors still
as they were for so many years when
they made Concord America's literary
shrine.</p>

<p class="indent">Evening came, and the two pilgrims
read together the Alcott journals and
letters. The ink was faded, the quaint,
old-fashioned writing was hard to decipher,
but, beginning with a letter to
Louisa written by Bronson Alcott when
his daughter was seven years old, they
read on until the dawn.</p>

<p class="indent">Only one result could be expected
from such an experience. They asked
permission to publish the letters and
such portions of the journals as would
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span>
most completely reveal the rare spiritual
companionship existing between the
Alcott parents and children. And, asking,
they were refused, because of a
feeling that the letters and journals were
intimate family records, to be read, not
by the many, but by the few. This
same sentiment withheld the dramatization
of "Little Women" for many
years.</p>

<p class="indent">"You forget," they argued, holding
fast to the dimly written pages, "that
Bronson Alcott and Louisa Alcott are
a part of America's literary heritage.
They belong to the nation, to the world,
not alone to you."</p>

<p class="indent">This course of reasoning finally prevailed,
but not without many months of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span>
waiting. And thus, with the consent of
the Alcott heirs, the book of "Little
Women Letters from the House of
Alcott" came to be.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Alcott Boy</span></h3>

<p class="cap">ONCE upon a time in the little
town of Wolcott, Connecticut,
was born a boy destined to offer
to the world new and beautiful thoughts.
He was laughed at and misunderstood;
but the thoughts were truth, and they
have lived, although the boy grew weary
and old and passed on.</p>

<p class="indent">The boy was Amos Bronson Alcott.
He was a country lad, used from infancy
to the rugged life of the farm, with its
self-denial and makeshifts. The seeming
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>
disadvantage, however, proved quite
the opposite. His close communion with
Nature brought him nearer to the truths
of life. For him God ceased to be a
mythical object to be studied and read
about on Sunday; but, as he roamed
the fields and climbed the hills, the lad
found Him in the rocks and the woodlands,
and in the sparkling streams. He
became a reality. The boy and God
were friends.</p>

<p class="indent">Of schooling he had little. When
work at the farm permitted, he attended
the country school near his father's house.
"Our copies," he told his little daughters,
"were set by the schoolmaster in books
made of a few sheets of foolscap, stitched
together and ruled with a leather plummet.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>
We used ink made of maple and
oak bark, which we manufactured ourselves.
With this I began keeping a
diary of my doings."</p>

<p class="indent">This was when the boy was twelve.
His hours at school were few, but as he
went about his daily tasks on the farm,
his thoughts grew and grew until his
mental stature far exceeded his physical.
He read as he guided the plow along
the furrow, sometimes unmindful of his
work until a sudden punch from a neglected
handle, as the plow struck a
stone, would bring him back to earth with
a thump. He sowed seeds in the moist,
sweet earth, but his face was turned to
the skies, and he knew the clouds and
the stars. When he gathered firewood,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span>
his eyes were keen for the soft, dainty
mosses, the clinging lichens. As he
picked berries for the home table, he
never missed the whirr of a bird wing
or passed unnoticed the modest flowers
half hidden in the soil. Nature was his
library, and she spread out her choicest
treasures to this growing boy.</p>

<p class="indent">A love for all of God's creations characterized
him. He was fond, not only
of the growing things in the wood, but of
all life. His love for animals amounted
almost to a passion, one reason for his
being a strict vegetarian and insisting
upon bringing up his little family on a
vegetable diet. But in boyhood it was
not always clear whether humanity or
the craving for knowledge made him so
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>
considerate of the plodding team in the
field. Never was team more carefully
tended. Many were its hours of grazing,
when the noonday sun rode high
in the heavens, and the Alcott boy,
book in hand, curled up under the shade
of a gigantic elm and read until the
shadows began to lengthen. But these
lapses were only occasional, for the
lad was faithful to his tasks, except
when he yielded to the lure of the
printed page.</p>

<p class="indent">When scarcely more than a child he
began to keep a record of his books and
his reading, showing the first traces of
the reflective, introspective quality of
mind which later led him to set down
in letters and unpublished manuscripts
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>
his inmost thoughts. He cultivated the
same habits of thought in his children,
one reason, doubtless, for Louisa's accurate
and realistic descriptions of the
lives of the four Little Women of the
Alcott family.</p>

<p class="indent">His favorite books in boyhood, and,
for that matter, in manhood, were the
Bible and Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress,"
which he read and reread and commented
upon. Years later he mentions
in his journal that he made it a practice
to read "Pilgrim's Progress" every year,
which is a remarkable record to the
modern boy and girl who find it difficult
to struggle through that wonderful allegory
even once.</p>

<p class="indent">Bronson Alcott took his chance and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>
made a stepping-stone of every difficulty.
Each obstacle he encountered in getting
an education created in him an even
stronger determination to gain one. The
modern boy has the world of books
opened wide to him through the library
and the free school. The treasures of
art are spread out before him in the
museums. He is surrounded by helps.
The boy of to-day is studied as an entity.
The boy of the last century could tell
quite a different story.</p>

<p class="indent">So the Alcott boy, passing long hours
in the woods, reading, thinking, getting
close to Nature and to God, walked as
one apart, seeing the invisible. While
still a boy, he began casting off the garment
of a conventional creed and to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span>
think for himself of God, the creation, of
life, unconsciously putting from him the
trammeling, cumbersome conventions
with which man has often hidden truth.</p>

<p class="indent">Out of this the man Alcott emerged&mdash;a
great soul.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Alcott Man</span></h3>

<p class="indent">With Bronson Alcott the craving for
knowledge was scarcely stronger than the
craving for adventure, so it is not surprising
that in the first flush of young manhood
he did not settle down to life on
the farm. He longed for the great world
lying beyond the hills and valleys of
peaceful New England. He wanted
experience, and experience he had.</p>

<p class="indent">He went South, hoping to teach school,
as he had original ideas on the training
of children. Unsuccessful in this, he
decided to be a peddler, naïvely remarking
that "honesty of purpose could dignify
any profession."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>
Think of the courage of this boy, for
he was scarcely more than a boy, a philosopher
at heart, living in a world of
dreams and books, his ambitions all for
intellectual rather than material achievement,
tramping the southern countryside,
undauntedly peddling buttons,
elastic, pins and needles, and supplying
all the small wants of the country housewife!
Often he encountered rebuffs,
sometimes he had a hearty welcome, for
the visit of the country peddler was
eagerly awaited by the children. At
times, when night came and he was far
from the shelter of an inn, he had to beg
a lodging from some planter. On one
such occasion, as he entered the grounds,
he saw a huge sign, "Beware the dog."
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span>
A shout from the house also warned him,
and he saw dashing toward him a savage-looking
dog, powerful enough to have
torn to pieces the slender young peddler-student.
But his love for animals triumphed.
Alcott stretched out his hand.
The huge creature stopped short; then,
recognizing a friend and a fearless one,
he bounded on, tail wagging, barking
joyously, snuggling his nose into the
young man's palm, which he licked as
he escorted his new-found friend to the
house. Animals always recognized in
Alcott an understanding comrade.</p>

<p class="indent">From most of these trips Alcott
brought back money to add to the
scanty funds at home, but on one memorable
occasion the love of finery proved
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span>
stronger than the necessity for saving,
and he returned to the farm penniless,
but dressed in the latest fashion, having
used his savings for a wardrobe that
was the wonder of the countryside.
That one debauch of clothes satisfied
him for life; after that his tastes were
markedly simple. With him the "dandy
period" was short-lived indeed. That
he repented bitterly of this one excess of
folly is shown in his journals, where he
sets down minutely what to him was a
mistake that amounted almost to a sin.
As a rule, he was singularly free from
folly. His thoughts were too high, his
ideals too lofty, for him to be long concerned
with trifles such as clothes, and
the next expenditure mentioned in his
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>
journal is for the "Vicar of Wakefield"
and Johnson's "Rasselas." Ever impractical,
one likes him the better for
the little human moment when the vanities
of the world overcame him.</p>

<p class="indent">At last he secured a school, and then
began the realization of his ideals regarding
the teaching of children. His
methods were original and highly successful,
especially with the very young.
He established a mental kindergarten,
and the fame of his teaching spread
abroad. Through his work as a teacher
he achieved his greatest happiness, for it
led to his meeting with the woman who
was destined to become his wife.</p>

<p class="indent">As the result of correspondence between
himself and Mr. May of Brooklyn,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span>
Connecticut, whose attention had been
attracted to the work of the young
teacher, Alcott, then twenty-eight years
old, drove from the Wolcott home to
Brooklyn, where he met Abigail May of
Boston, who was visiting her brother.
With both it was love at first sight, a love
that grew into a perfect spiritual union.</p>

<p class="indent">It seemed almost providential that
Bronson Alcott should have come into
Abigail May's life at just this time, when
her heart had been touched by its first
great sorrow&mdash;the loss of her mother.
Hitherto she had been a light-hearted girl,
fond of dancing and of the material side
of life. The young philosopher, with his
dreams and his ideals, brought a new
interest into her now lonely life, and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span>
all that was spiritual in her nature responded
as he freely discussed his plans
and ambitions with her. In her he
found both sympathy and understanding.</p>

<p class="indent">A year of letter-writing, a frank and
honest exchange of thought, brought out
the harmony of their natures and developed
in both a sense of oneness, laying
a firm foundation for the comradeship
which was not broken through all the
years, even when the wife and mother
passed into the Great Beyond.</p>

<p class="indent">The Alcott-May courtship was ideal.
Retaining the heaven that lay about
him in his infancy, keeping his close
companionship with God and God's
great laboratory, Nature, Bronson Alcott
demanded something more than mere
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>
physical attraction in choosing his wife.
A certain quaint circumspection characterized
their love-making. Abigail May
once wrote: "Mr. Alcott's views on
education were very attractive, and I was
charmed by his modesty," and long after
their engagement she spoke of her lover as
"her friend." He was, and so he continued
to be in the highest sense of the
word.</p>

<p class="indent">So satisfying were those friendship-courtship
days, that apparently both
were loath to end them, for another
twelvemonth passed before the announcement
of their betrothal, and it was nearly
three years from the date of their first
meeting before their marriage in King's
Chapel, Boston, where the brother who
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>
had been the means of bringing them
together performed the ceremony.</p>

<p class="indent">As their marriage day approached,
there was little festivity and none of the
rush that usually precedes a modern
wedding. Everything was simple, quiet,
and sure.</p>

<p class="indent">This is Bronson Alcott's letter, asking
a friend to act as best man at his wedding.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">Dear Sir:</p>

<p class="indent">Permit me to ask the favor of your
calling at Col. May's at 4 o'clock precisely
on Sunday afternoon next, to accompany me
and my friend Miss May to King's Chapel.</p>

So began the Alcott pilgrimage, their
fortune consisting of love and faith and
brains. In these they were rich indeed,
and thus closed another chapter in the
life of the gentle philosopher, of whom
Ralph Waldo Emerson once said: "Our
Alcott has only just missed being a
seraph."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Alcott Children</span>
</h3>

<p class="cap">FOR some months after their marriage
the Alcotts lived in Boston,
where the young enthusiast taught
a school for infants. Again his fame as
a teacher traveled, and he received an
offer from the Quakers of Philadelphia
to start a school there, an offer so tempting
that the Alcotts moved to Germantown,
Pennsylvania, where Anna and
Louisa were born.</p>

<p class="indent">Eugenics and prenatal influence were
not discussed then as they are to-day,
but in the Alcott family nearly a century
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span>
ago they were being thought and lived.
Bronson Alcott and his wife considered
children an expression, not of themselves,
but of divinity, and as such to be accepted
as a trust, rather than as a gratification
of their own human longing for
fatherhood and motherhood. They felt
it their parental privilege rather than
their duty to aid the human development
of the child and thus further the fulfillment
of its destiny. Each little soul
was humbly asked for and reverently
prepared for. From the moment they
knew their prayer had been granted, the
individuality and rights of that soul
were respected. It was considered as
a little guest that must be made happy
and comfortable, carefully cherished,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>
mentally and physically, while its fleshly
garment was being prepared and the little
personality made ready for its earthly
appearance. How careful they were of
every thought and influence, for to both
parents this period was the most sacred
and wonderful in their lives and in the
lives of their children.</p>

<p class="indent">The depth of his joy and the simplicity
of his faith are exquisitely expressed in
the lines which Bronson Alcott wrote
before the birth of his first child, Anna:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">To An Expectant Mother</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The long advancing hour draws nigh&mdash;the hour<br />
When life's young pulse begins its mystic play,<br />
And deep affection's dreams of Form or Joy<br />
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>
Shall be unveiled, a bodily presence<br />
To thy yearning heart and fond maternal eye,<br />
The primal Soul, a semblance of thine own,<br />
Its high abode shall leave and dwell in day,<br />
Thyself its forming Parent. A miracle, indeed,<br />
Shall nature work. Thou shalt become<br />
The bearing mother of an Infant Soul&mdash;<br />
Its guardian spirit to its home above.<br />
But yet erewhile the lagging moments come<br />
That layeth the living, conscious, burden down,<br />
Firm faith may rest in hope. Accordant toils<br />
Shall leave no time for fear, nor doubt, nor gloom.<br />
Love, peace, and virtue, are all born of Pain,<br />
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span>
And He who rules o'er these is ever good.<br />
The joyous promise is to her who trusts,<br />
Who trusting, gains the vital boon she asks,<br />
And meekly asking, learns to trust aright.
</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Louisa, the second child, born on her
father's birthday, was the most intellectual
and the most resourceful of the
Alcott children, reflecting in her own
buoyant personality the happy conditions
existing before and at the time of
her birth, when her father had attained
his greatest material prosperity and was
also realizing his mental ambitions in
his little school, and her mother was
temporarily relieved from the cares that
so often weighed heavily upon her.</p>

<p class="indent">Shortly before the birth of Elizabeth
the father makes this entry in his journal:
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<h3><span class="smcap">The Advent Cometh</span></h3>

<p class="indent">Daily am I in expectation of beholding with
the eye of sense, the spirit that now lingers
on the threshold of this terrestrial life, and
only awaits the bidding of the Reaper within,
to usher itself into the presence of mortals.
It standeth at the door and waiteth for admission
to the exterior scene of things....
Let the time come. Two little ones in advance
await its coming; and greetings of
joy shall herald its approach.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The birth of Elizabeth is followed by
this entry in his journal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">At sunset this day a daughter was born
to us.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">One of the most trying of the Alcott
family's experiences came after the birth
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span>
of Elizabeth, when Bronson Alcott, again
in Boston, aroused a storm of protest
with his radical teachings and his
advanced interpretations of the Bible.
Shocked that the city where he expected
to find sympathy and encouragement
should have repudiated him, his school
disrupted and abject poverty his lot,
broken mentally and physically, he met
with another cruel disappointment in
the death of his infant son. Yet even
then there was no word of bitterness,
and no mention is made in his journal
of the father's grief. Indirectly it is
expressed in a subsequent entry announcing
the birth of the fourth daughter,
Abba May.</p>

<p class="indent">She was born under sunny skies. The
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span>
storm had passed, and the Alcott family
had removed to Concord, where they
enjoyed many of their happiest years.
A presage of May Alcott's artistic gifts,
her queenly bearing, elegance, and charm,
all familiar to readers of "Little Women,"
is found in this entry in the father's
journal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
July, 1840.
</p>

<p class="indent">A new life has arrived to us (July 26th).
She was born with the dawn, and is a proud
little Queen, not deigning to give us the light
of her royal presence, but persists in sleeping
all the time, without notice of the broad world
or ourselves. Providence, it seems, decrees
that we shall provide selectest ministries
alone, and so sends us successive daughters
of Love to quicken the Sons of Life. We
joyfully acquiesce in the Divine behest and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>
are content to rear women for the future
world. As yet the ministry is unknown in
the culture of the nations, but the hour
draws near when love shall be felt as a chosen
Bride of Wisdom, and the celestial pair
preside over all the household of mankind.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Bronson Alcott did not feel his responsibility
as a father alone; he appreciated
his own debt to his children, the
mental and spiritual help that came
to him through them, an appreciation
that found expression in this poem, entered
in his journal before the birth of
Elizabeth:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">June, 1835</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Invocation to a Child</span></h3>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Alcott Baby Book</span></h3>

<p class="cap">BRONSON ALCOTT wrote the first
Baby Book, a book which throws
new light on the character of the
lovable philosopher, showing one of New
England's intellectual leaders as a very
human and lovable man as well as "a
fond and foolish father."</p>

<p class="indent">His Baby Book, however, contains no
minute record of the first tooth, or
when the baby began to say "Goo"
and "Pitty light"; rather it is the
father's earnest effort to learn how early
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span>
in life the infant mind begins to awaken,
to indicate comprehension, thought, or
logic. As Maeterlinck studied the bee,
so Alcott studied his children, and his
findings are a revelation, even to-day,
when the study of the child has become
a science.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Alcott considered vital the development
of the child's individuality and
mind; the body seemed to him of secondary
importance, for this disregard
of the material care of his family
he has been severely censured; but, not
recognizing in his own life the claims of
the body, devoting all his energies to
mental growth, it is not surprising that
he found his fatherly duty in the guidance
of his children's minds. His firm
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>
faith in the admonition, "Seek ye first
the kingdom of heaven, and all these
things shall be added unto you," was to
him excuse enough for considering the
intellect more than the body.</p>

<p class="indent">His practical shortcomings reaped a
rich and unexpected reward in the next
generation, for Louisa M. Alcott would
probably not have developed her original
and highly entertaining literary gift
without the vicissitudes caused by her
father's impractical nature and his sublime
faith that at all times and in all
emergencies the Lord would provide.
He did provide; but Louisa was usually
the channel, and many of her stories
were written under the whip of stern
necessity.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span>
Doing without has its advantages.
The Alcott children, never overfed, overentertained,
overburdened to baby boredom
with dolls and toys and games, developed
appreciation, observation, and
ingenuity. The creative faculty was
aroused. They found resources within
themselves. What a handbook Louisa
might have written on How to be Happy
though Poor!</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Alcott's keen sense of humor, a
characteristic inherited by Louisa, often
came to her rescue and allowed her to
get fun out of a harassing situation. In
a letter to her brother, Colonel May,
praising her husband's intellect, she
laughingly comments upon his disregard
of physical necessities: "I am not
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span>
sure that we shall not blush into obscurity
and contemplate into starvation."</p>

<p class="indent">But, to get back to the baby book, or,
as Mr. Alcott called it, "the psychological
history," it was started with a high
and unselfish motive; it was developed
to an astonishing degree. Its purpose
and scope are best expressed in this
extract from Mr. Alcott's journal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">The history of a human mind during its
progressive stages of earthly experience has
never as yet, I believe, been attempted.
Faithfully compiled, from verified data, it
would be a treasure of wisdom to all mankind,
replete with light to the metaphysical and
ethical inquirer. Comparative philosophy
deduced from an observation of man during
all circumstances and stages of his existence
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span>
is a thing yet unthought of among us. From
such a work the unity of Humanity might be
revealed.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">When Anna was born, the father
began keeping a record of her "physical
and intellectual progress." When she
was seven weeks old, her mother wrote:
"It seems as if she were conscious of
his observations and desirous of furnishing
him daily with an item for this
record."</p>

<p class="indent">The following excerpt from the father's
diary shows how well Anna succeeded
in her baby attempt:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">I am much interested in the progress of
my little girl, now five months old, which I
have recorded from the day of her birth.
This record has swollen to a hundred pages.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span>
I have attempted to discover, as far as this
could be done by external indication, the
successive steps of her physical, mental and
moral advancement.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Moral advancement of a baby five
months old!</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Birth of Louisa</span></h3>

<p class="indent">On November 29, 1832, his thirty-third
birthday and also the natal day of
his friend, Ellery Channing, the poet,
Mr. Alcott chronicles an "interesting
event," how interesting the father little
dreamed, nor how important, not alone
to the house of Alcott, but to the world.
Under the heading of Circumstances,
the father thus records the birth of
Louisa May Alcott:
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">A daughter born, on the 29th. ulto., my
birthday, being 33 years of age. This is
a most interesting event. Unless those ties
which connect it with others are formed, the
wants of the soul become morbid and all its
fresh and primal affections become dim and
perverted.... Few can be happy shut
out of the nursery of the soul.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">While the New England philosopher
was studying the development of his little
daughters and deducing therefrom facts
for his psychological history, these same
little daughters were developing him, for,
as the child nature unfolded, the father's
understanding of childhood expanded.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus the baby book grew:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">The influence of children I regard as
important to my own improvement and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span>
happiness. It is also necessary to the
prosecution of my studies. Dwelling in the
primal regions which I wish to explore, they
are the purest manifestations of its phenomena,
and the only subjects from which
humanity is to be interpreted in its purity.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">When Anna was three years old and
Louisa eighteen months, the father writes
in his journal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">I passed some time with the children,
fitting up their playthings, conversing with
them and learning as far as I could through
the subtle meaning of looks, accents and
gestures, their thoughts and feelings. The
avenues to the spirit are all open, but how
dim are our perceptions, how cold our
sympathies, to appreciate the pure and
bright things which glitter in the arena of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span>
the young mind! How little of this fairy
land do we know&mdash;we, whose early associations
have all been swept from the heart&mdash;over
whose spirits have passed the cold winds,
the pelting storms, withering and destroying
the heart's young verdure! What is there
to unite us with the spirit of a child? What
have we in common with its joyous yearning
for the beautiful, its trust in human sayings,
its deep love for those on whom it relies
for attention and support, its vivid picturing
of ideal life, its simplicity, its freedom from
prejudice and false sentiment? Where are
these to be seen in our dim nature?</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">He might have answered the question
by looking within himself. Child companionship
kept alive the spirit of the
Alcott boy, which constantly shone
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 49]</span>
through the man's philosophy. As the
boy saw in every rock and tree and
flower an expression of the Infinite, is it
any wonder that the man should have
recognized God's higher manifestation
in the child, and should have written
in his journal these lines, which are the
very glorification of fatherhood and reveal
the sacredness with which he looked
upon his stewardship?</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">He who deals with the child deals&mdash;did
he know it&mdash;with the Infinite. Within the
young spirit committed to his care are infinite
capacities to be filled, infinite energies
to be developed, and on him devolves the
amazing responsibility&mdash;sacred, personal,
all his own&mdash;of filling these capacities,
unfolding these energies, from the stores and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span>
life of his own spirit. This is his office as a
parent. But how can he who knows nothing
of the Infinite within himself call it forth and
direct its forces in others?</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">From the first, Louisa must have
shown strong individuality and unusual
tendencies, for Mr. Alcott's notes on
Louisa are entitled "Observations on the
Vital Phenomena of My Second Child."
A more vital, lovable, contradictory
specimen of childhood cannot be imagined.
Blessed with her father's brilliancy of
mind, her mother's quick wit and love of
fun, Louisa furnished a problem for endless
study. She was less than two years
old when her individuality had so asserted
itself that her father found himself puzzled
and admitted that elements were
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 51]</span>
finding their way into his observations of
whose origin he could give no account.
"My analysis, however accurate and
elaborate, was still imperfect, and I
was left in doubt. I had made no provision
for the admission of innate influences
from the mind itself."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p class="indent">Here is a quaint little record of the
Alcott babies' school days, when Anna
was four years old and Louisa a little
more than two:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">At school Anna reads, marks and listens
to conversations and stories. Louisa works
with her in all except the reading and marking.
They have a playroom, where they
enjoy their own amusements, uninterrupted
by the presence of adults&mdash;often a bar to
the genuine happiness of childhood. Anna
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span>
reads simple sentences from Leffanoch's
Primer, writes intelligibly on tablets and
slates, and is improving in work and manners.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">(This of a baby of four.)</p>

<p class="indent">A spiritual and moral inventory of
the progress of Anna and Louisa is set
down by the father when his daughters
had reached the dignified ages of six
and four:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">The children have improved under my
training. Anna, who has been with me more
of the time than Louisa, has been greatly
benefited. She is happier, more capable
of self control, more docile and obeys from
love and faith. She has fine elements for
excellence, moral and intellectual. If she
does not evince a pure and exalted character,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span>
it will be our failure, not hers, in the improvement
of her natural endowments.</p>

<p class="indent">Louisa is yet too young for the formation
of just views of her character. She manifests
uncommon activity and force of mind at
present, and is much in advance of her sister
at the same age; example has done much to
call forth her nature. She is more active
and practical than Anna. Anna is ideal,
sentimental. Louisa is practical, energetic.
The first imagines much more than she can
realize; the second, by force of will and
practical talent, realizes all that she conceives&mdash;but
conceives less; understanding, rather
than imagination&mdash;the gift of her sister&mdash;seems
to be her prominent faculty. She finds
no difficulty in developing ways and means to
obtain her purpose; while her sister, aiming
at much, imagining ideal forms of good, and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 54]</span>
shaping them out so vividly in her mind
that they become actual enjoyments, fails,
when she attempts to realize them in nature&mdash;she
has been dwelling on the higher and
more speculative relations of things.</p>

<p class="indent">Both represent interesting forms of character,
both have wide and useful spheres of
action indicated in their conformation and will
doubtless if continued to us, be real blessings.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">That they did prove real blessings the
history of the Alcott family has shown.</p>

their spiritual debt to the gift of fatherhood
as has Bronson Alcott:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">I know not how much more spiritual I
am from the parental relation (he writes),
how much I have been indebted to them
for the light that hath dawned upon my own
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span>
mind from the radiance of their simple
spirits. Certain it is that the more I associate
with them in the simple ways they
love, the more do I seem to revere. Verily
had I not been called to associate with children,
had I not devoted myself to the study
of human nature in its period of infancy and
childhood, I should never have found the
tranquil repose, the steady faith, the vivid
hope that now sheds a glory and a dignity
around the humble path of my life. Childhood
hath saved me.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Out of his theories, his studies, and
meditations came a sublime ambition, a
desire to become a laborer in the "Field
of the Soul."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">Infancy I shall invest with a glory&mdash;a
spirituality which the disciples of Jesus,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span>
deeply as they entered into His spirit and
caught the life of His mind, have failed to
bring forth in their records of His sayings and
life. I shall redeem infancy and childhood,
and, if a Saviour of Adults was given in the
person of Jesus, let me, without impiety or
arrogance, regard myself as the Children's
Saviour. Divine are both missions. Both
seek out and endeavor to redeem the Infinite
in man, which, by reason of the clogs of
sense and custom, is in perpetual danger of
being lost. The chief obstacle in the way
of human regeneration is the want of a due
appreciation of human nature, and particularly
of the nature of children.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Home and its influence upon children
meant much to Mr. Alcott, and in all
his writing the nearest approach to a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span>
protest against the poverty he was called
upon to endure was when, for a time, he
was obliged to give up that home. Deep
is the pathos that lies between the lines
of this entry in his journal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<h3><span class="smcap">Home for Children</span></h3>

<p class="indent">I deem it very important to the well being
of my children to insure them a home. At
least their means of improvement are limited,
their pleasures are abridged, the domestic
relations, so vital to virtue&mdash;to all that
lives in the heart and imagination, are
robbed of their essential glory, and the effect
is felt throughout the character in after life.
I feel that my duty as a father cannot be
fully carried out when I am thus restricted.
Whether we can yet improve this condition
remains to be determined.</p>
</div><p class="indent"></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 58]</span>

such a home! An influence felt throughout

<p class="cap">HAPPINESS reigned in the Alcott
home, and poverty seldom brought
with it a shadow. The girls had
toys and a variety of them,&mdash;rag dolls,
kittens, gingerbread men, and barnyard
animals (the latter skillfully cut out of
cake dough by the mother, who had a
genius for inventing surprises). As they
grew older, they delighted in private
theatricals. Some of their plays, written
by Anna and Louisa, have been published
under the title of "Comic Tragedies."
They are thrillingly melodramatic,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 60]</span>
thickly sprinkled with villains and
heroes, witches and ruffians, lovely
ladies in distress, gallant knights to the
rescue, evil spirits and good fairies,
gnomes and giants. All are direfully
tragic and splendidly spectacular.
Louisa as a child showed the dramatic
quality which later found artistic
expression in her stories. On a rainy
afternoon the children were never at a
loss for entertainment. They "acted"
in the attic or played dolls in their own
playroom, and such dolls! Old Joanna,
of whom Louisa has drawn a lifelike picture
in "Little Women," is to-day in
existence, battered, scarred, but none the
less precious, one foot carefully bandaged,
after the army-nurse method.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span>
Poverty was made interesting. At
Christmas a tree was hung with apples,
nuts, and popped corn, and small trifles
made by the children were fastened to
the branches. Father and mother made
much of the spirit of the Christ birthday,
which was celebrated in simple, wholesome
fashion, in vivid contrast to the
modern Christmas festival.</p>

<p class="indent">The Alcott letters and journals show
tremendous intellectual activity on the
part of the small atoms of humanity who
came to grace the Alcott home. Anna
and her father held moral and intellectual
discussions when Anna was four. Louisa
was writing a daily journal before she
could more than print. As soon as a
child could read, family reproofs were
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 62]</span>
administered by notes from father and
mother to the erring one, not only pointing
out the fault, but how to correct it.</p>

<p class="indent">The father encouraged his daughters
to study themselves and to write down
their thoughts. Their journals, in consequence,
reflect the characteristics of
each one and are storehouses of information.
Louisa, poor little soul, in her
happy, hoydenish childhood, found time
one day in a fit of mentality to set down
in black and white her chief faults. One
of her most serious, according to the self-imposed
confession, was "love of cats,"
a sin which easily beset her all her days,
for she inherited her father's love of animals
and of children.</p>

<p class="indent">Widely varied in character and temperament
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 63]</span>
were the four Alcott girls.
Anna, the first, reflected the beauty, the
happiness, and the romance of the Alcotts'
first year of married life. Louisa,
born some eighteen months later, when
father and mother had grown even closer
together through the new bond formed
by the love of their little daughter, embodied
a deeper, stronger, surer character.
She was decisive, with a determination
and surety of self and brilliancy
of mind that reflected the best
in both parents. Elizabeth, the third
child, was, in some respects, the most
beautiful character of all. About her,
from the hour of her conception, seemed
to hover a spiritual, protecting love.
Seemingly from earliest infancy she stood
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span>
on the borderland of the spiritual world,
in flesh all too fragile to retain the spirit
which remembered and longed, notwithstanding
the love with which she was
surrounded, to return to the mystical
beauty from which she had come. A
child of dreams and fancies, loving all
that was harmonious, she entered this
life at twilight, she left it at the dawn,
a coming and going typical of this dream
child, who was lent for a little time to
make the world more glad.</p>

<p class="indent">The birth of Amy is also symbolical,
the one sunny-haired, sunny-hearted girl
of the family, who came with the rising
of the sun. She seemed made for love,
sunshine, and happiness, and had them
all, but she was brave to face hardships
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 65]</span>
and equally ready to accept comfort and
luxury. A queen, the father called her
the morning of her birth, and so they
brought her up, the Little Snow Queen.</p>

<p class="indent">The wise, fostering love of the father,
the helpful, understanding watchfulness
of the mother, are reflected in their
letters to their children. Time was not
considered wasted that was devoted to
these letters of gentle admonition and
kindly counsel. There was no discussion
of faults or mistakes in the Alcott household;
reproofs remained little secrets
between father and daughter, or mother
and daughter, and the effect of this wise
and constant watchfulness grows more
apparent as the children advance from
childhood to girlhood and on to womanhood.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 66]</span>
They were taught to know themselves.
They were taught, too, the relation
of the Christ child with their own
childhood, beautifully expressed in some
of the letters from Bronson Alcott to his
eldest daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the father's habit to write each
child on her birthday anniversary and
at Christmas. Anna was six years old
when he gave her this beautiful description
of the coming of the Christ:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
For Anna<br />
1837</p>
<p>To my Daughter Anna.</p>

<p class="indent">A longer time ago than you can understand,
a beautiful Babe was born. Angels
sang at his birth. And stars shone brightly.
Shepherds watched their flocks by their
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span>
light. The Babe was laid in his Manger-cradle.
And harmless oxen fed by his side.
There was no room for him nor his mother in
the Inn, as she journeyed from her own home.</p>

<p class="indent">This Babe was born at this time of the
year. His name was Jesus. And he is
also called Christ. This is his birth night.
And we call it Christ-mas, after him.</p>

<p class="indent">I write you this little note as a Christmas
Gift, and hope my little girl will remember the
birth night of Jesus. Think how beautiful he
was, and try to shine in lovely actions as he
did. God never had a child that pleased him
so well. Be like a kind sister of his, and so
please your Father, who loves you very much.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span>
Again on Christmas Eve, two years
later, he describes to his little daughter
of eight years her own coming into the
world of material things.</p>

<p class="indent">The belief in prenatal influence is
strongly indicated, for the father tells
his little girl that they thought just how
she would look and pictures to her the
joy and the love with which she was surrounded
before her coming into the land
of the material and first seeing with her
baby eyes the light of a world day.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">

<p class="indent">You were once pleased, my daughter, with
a little note which I wrote you on Christmas
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 69]</span>
Eve, concerning the birth of Jesus. I am
now going to write a few words about your
own Birth. Mother and I had no child.
We wanted one&mdash;a little girl just like you;
and we thought how you would look, and
waited a good while for you to come, so
that we might see you and have you for our
own. At last you came. We felt so happy
that joy stood in our eyes. You looked
just as we wanted to have you. You were
draped in a pretty little white frock, and
father took you in his arms every day, and
we loved you very much. Your large
bright eyes looked lovingly into ours, and
you soon learned to love and know us. When
you were a few weeks old, you smiled
on us. We lived then in Germantown.
It is now more than eight years since this
happened, but I sometimes see the same
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 70]</span>
look and the same smile on your face, and
feel that my daughter is yet good and pure.

it.</p>

<p class="indent">On her birthday some three months
later, he continues the thought in this
exquisite letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">March 16, 1840.</p>

<p>My dear Daughter,</p>

<p class="indent">With this morning's dawn opens a
new year of your Life on Earth. Nine years
ago you were sent, a sweet Babe into this
world, a joy and hope to your father and
mother. After a while, through many smiles
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 71]</span>
and some few tears, you learned to lisp the
names of father and mother, and to make
them feel once more how near and dear
you were to their hearts whenever you named
their names. Now you are a still dearer
object of Love and hope to them as your love
buds and blossoms under their eye. They
watch this flower as it grows in the Garden
of Life, and scents the air with its fragrance,
and delights the eye by its colours. Soon
they will look not for Beauty and fragrance
alone, but for the ripening and ripe fruit.
May it be the Spirit of Goodness; may its
leaves never wither, its flowers never fade;
its fragrance never cease; but may it flourish
in perpetual youth and beauty, and be transplanted
in its time, into the Garden of God,
whose plants are ever green, ever fresh, and
bloom alway, the amaranth of Heaven, the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span>
pride and joy of angels. Thus writes your
Father to you on this your birth morn.</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">This letter and his allusion to "your
life on earth" show plainly his belief
in life eternal, for Bronson Alcott considered
earthly existence merely a period
in the evolution of the soul.</p>

<p class="indent">On Christmas Eve, 1840; when Anna
was nearly ten, Louisa just past her
eighth birthday, May, the golden-haired
baby of the Alcott household, and Elizabeth
the little shadow child of four, he
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 73]</span>
wrote Christmas letters to his daughters,
which show his appreciation of their
special needs, and his respect for their
individualities. The letter to Elizabeth
is missing; to Anna he wrote:</p>

<p class="center">For Anna<br />

Almost without the dates, one could
keep track of the development of the
Alcott girls through their father's letters.
This one demonstrates his gift of teaching
by the use of suggestion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
For Anna<br />
1842<br />
<span class="u">A Father's Gift</span><br />

<span class="u">Daughter</span><br />
on her<br />
<span class="u">Eleventh Birthday</span>.<br />
Concordia<br />
16th March<br />
1842</p>

<p class="indent">My dear daughter,
</p>

<p class="indent">This is your eleventh birthday, and
as I have heretofore addressed a few words
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 77]</span>
to you on these interesting occasions, I
will not depart from my former custom
now.</p>

<p class="indent">And my daughter, what shall I say to you?
Shall I say something to please or to instruct
you&mdash;to flatter or benefit you? I know
you dislike being pleased unless the pleasure
make you better, and you dislike all flattery.
And you know too, that your father never
gave you a word of flattery in his life. So
there remains for you the true and purest
pleasure of being instructed and benefited
by words of love and the deepest regard
for your improvement in all that shall
make you more happy in yourself and
beautiful to others. And so I shall speak
plainly to you of yourself, and of my desire
for your improvement in several important
things.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span>
<span class="u">First&mdash;Your Manners.</span> Try to be more
gentle. You like gentle people and every
one is more agreeable as he cultivates this
habit. None can be agreeable who are destitute
of it and how shall you become more
gentle? Only by governing your passions,
and cherishing your love to everyone who is
near you. Love is gentle: Hate is violent.
Love is well-mannered; Selfishness is rude,
vulgar. Love gives sweet tone to the voice,
and makes the countenance lovely. Love
then, and grow fair and agreeable.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="u">Second: Be Patient.</span> This is one of the
most difficult things to everyone, old or
young. But it is also one of the greatest
things. And this comes of Love too. Love
is Patient: it bears; it suffers long; it is
kind; it is beautiful; it makes us like
angels. Patience is, indeed, angelic; it is
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 79]</span>
the Gate that opens into the House of Happiness.
Open it, my daughter, and enter in
and take all your sisters in with you.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="u">Third: Be Resolute.</span> Shake off all Sluggishness,
and follow your Confidence as
fast as your feelings, your thoughts, your
eye, your hand, your foot, will carry you.
Hate all excuses: almost always, these are
lies. Be <span class="u">quick</span> in your obedience: delay
is a laggard, who never gets up with himself,
and loses the company of confidence always.
Resolution is the ladder to Happiness.
Resolve and be a wise and happy girl.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="u">Fourth: Be Diligent.</span> Put your heart into
all you do: and fix your thoughts on your
doings. Halfness is almost as bad as nothing:
be whole then in all you do and say.</p>

<p class="indent">But I am saying a great deal and will stop
now with the hope of meeting you on the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span>
16th March, 1843 (the good God sparing us
till then) a gentler, a meeker, more determined
and obligent girl.</p>

<p class="indent">Such a gift to an eleven-year-old girl
on her birthday! One would expect
not kindly counsel, but a toy, a picture
book, something pretty for her body,
not much for her mind. The spirituality
and the wisdom of the poet-philosopher
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 81]</span>
are shown in this letter with its
"excuses, almost always lies," and "delay
is a laggard."</p>

<p class="indent">When Louisa was seven years old, her
mother was ill, and the child was sent
away from home for a time. To his little

tell you. You shall see us all in a few

<p class="indent">You were never away from home so long

<p class="indent">You are Seven years old to-day and
your Father is forty. You have learned a
great many things, since you have lived in a
Body, about things going on around you and

to resolve, how to love, and how to obey.
You feel your Conscience, and have no real
pleasure unless you obey it. You cannot love
yourself, or anyone else, when you do not
mind its commandments. It asks you always
to BE GOOD, and bears, O how gently! how
patiently! with all endeavors to hate, and
treat it cruelly. How kindly it bears with

Happiness in your HEART when you Obey

<p class="indent">His explanation to a seven-year-old

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 85]</span>
at ten or eleven wrote that she was sure
in some previous life she must have been

<p class="center">1842</p>

<p>My Daughter,</p>

<p class="indent">This is your birthday: you are ten
years of age to-day. I sought amidst my
papers for some pretty picture to place at
the top of this note, but I did not find anything
that seemed at all expressive of my
interest in your well-being, or well-doing,
and so this note comes to you without any
such emblem. Let me say, my honest little
girl, that I have had you often in my mind
during my separation from you and your
devoted mother, and well-meaning sisters,
while on the sea or the land, and now that
I have returned to be with you and them
again, meeting you daily at fireside, at
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span>
table, at study, and in your walk, and amusements,
in conversation and in silence, being
daily with you, I would have you feel my
presence and be the happier, and better that
I am here. I want, most of all things, to
be a kindly influence on you, helping you
to guide and govern your heart, keeping it
in a state of sweet and loving peacefulness,
so that you may feel how good and kind is
that Love which lives always in our breasts,
and which we may always feel, if we will keep
the passions all in stillness and give up ourselves
entirely to its soft desires. I live,
my dear daughter, to be good and to do good
to all, and especially to you and your mother
and sisters. Will you not let me do you all
the good that I would? And do you not
know that I can do you little or none, unless
you give me your affections, incline your
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span>
ears, and earnestly desire to become daily
better and wiser, more kind, gentle, loving,
diligent, heedful, serene. The good Spirit
comes into the Breast of the meek and loveful
to abide long; anger, discontent, impatience,
evil appetites, greedy wants, complainings,
ill-speakings, idlenesses, heedlessness, rude
behaviour and all such, these drive it away,
or grieve it so that it leaves the poor misguided
soul to live in its own obstinate,
perverse, proud discomfort, which is the
very <span class="u">Pain of Sin</span>, and is in the <span class="u">Bible</span> called
the worm that never dies, the gnawing worm,
the sting of <span style="font-variant: small-caps; text-decoration: underline;">conscience</span>: while the pleasures
of love and goodness are beyond all description&mdash;a
peacefulness that passes all understanding.
I pray that my daughter may
know much of the last, and little of the first
of these feelings. I shall try every day to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</span>
help her to the knowledge and love of this
good <span class="u">Spirit</span>. I shall be with her, and as she
and her sisters come more and more into
the presence of this Spirit, shall we become
a family more closely united in loves that
can never sunder us from each other.</p>

<p class="indent">To little Elizabeth the letters were
few. The child was so constantly the
companion of father and mother, that by
speech rather than written word, their
messages were given. But on her fifth
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 92]</span>
birthday, her father carefully printed
this letter:</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Mother's Influence</span></h3>

<p class="cap">UPON the lives of all four of her
daughters the mother's influence
rested like a benediction. It is
felt in her letters; it is reflected in the
journals of her girls and in the musings
of Bronson Alcott, as set down
in his voluminous journals. And the
mother spirit hovers over Orchard House,
where "Little Women" was written and
lived.</p>

<p class="indent">While letters to Anna from her mother
are missing, Anna's journal shows how
vital was Mrs. Alcott's power in the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 99]</span>
upbuilding of her noble character.
Louisa in "Little Women" has said that
the girls gave their hearts into their
mother's keeping, their souls into their
father's. Anna's letters bear eloquent
testimony to the strong, helpful, cheery
influence of the mother upon the child.
Among the first was this letter, written
by Anna when she was five years old
and visiting Mr. Alcott's family at Wolcott:</p>

<p>My dear Mother,</p>

<p class="indent">I have to go away by myself and cry
because I want to see you so much, and
little sister Lizy and Louisa. Doctor Fuller
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 100]</span>

you in a few days. You have a splendid
husband</p>

<p class="indent">(On this she had drawn her hand.)</p>

<p class="indent">She was six years old when she wrote
this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">
Dear Mother,</p>

<p class="indent">I have not had a note from you for
a great while. You wanted some wafers
yesterday will you accept of them from me
There is not many but it is all that I have got.
I am very glad my birthday is so near for
as I grow older, I hope I shall grow better
and more useful to you, I hope soon we shall
be settled down in some comfortable little
home of our own and then shall be contented
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 101]</span>
and happy I hope. I must go to my sums
now, so goodbye dearest mother</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Your loving Anna</span></p>

<p class="indent">A letter eloquent of the tender relation
between mother and child is this written
during the Fruitlands period:</p>

<p class="indent">Dear mother.</p>

<p class="indent">I wish that you would come to the
table again. I enjoy my meals much better
when you are at the table. Was not "Heraclitus"
that father read about to-day, a dear
good man, it seems as though I wanted to
hug him up and kiss him. I wish men had
understood his thoughts better than they
did he would have been happier I think. I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 102]</span>
have enjoyed this morning readings and conversations
better than I have before for a
good while, I suppose, because I talked and
I understood it so well. I do not write to
you very often dear mother but I love to
dearly when I feel like it, and I love to have
letters from you. I have not been as good
as I wish I had this week. I send a little
bunch of flowers to you they are not very
pretty but they are beautifully made and
I thought you would like them. I had a
beautiful time walking this morning with
Louisa. Good bye dearest mother from
your loving</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Anna.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Many copies of her mother's letters
are found in Louisa's journals, showing
the daughter's intense, almost idolatrous
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 103]</span>
affection. Louisa admired, respected,
and loved her father, but to her
mother her tenderest thought was given.
Marmee understood the wayward,
tempestuous, lovable child as no one
else did, not even loyal Anna, or admiring
Elizabeth. On her birthday the
mother writes to Louisa:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">
My dear little girl,</p>

<p class="indent">Will you accept this doll from me
on your 7th birthday. She will be a quiet

years more. Be a kind mamma and love her
for my sake.</p>

<p>Dear Daughter,</p>

<p class="indent">Your 10th birthday has arrived, may
it be a happy one, &amp; on each returning birthday
may you feel new strength and resolution
to be gentle with sisters, obedient to parents,
loving to everyone &amp; happy in yourself.</p>

<p class="indent">I give you the pencil case I promised, for
I have observed that you are fond of writing
&amp; wish to encourage the habit.</p>

<p class="indent">Go on trying, dear, &amp; each day it will
be easier to be &amp; do good. You must help
yourself, for the cause of your little troubles
is in yourself, &amp; patience &amp; courage only
will make you what mother prays to see you
her good and happy girl.</p>

<p class="indent">During the Fruitlands period, when
Louisa was eleven, she found this little

<p class="indent">My dear,</p>

<p class="indent">Thank you for your sweet note and
sweeter poetry. The second verse is very
good. Your love of nature is pure and true.
It is a lovely school in which good lessons
may be learned. The happy industry of

of brooks all help&mdash;</p>

</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">In the following letter, a pretty little
deference to the child's own personality
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 106]</span>
is shown by the mother, in that way
bringing out in the child respect and
deference for others:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">
Dear Daughter,
</p>

<p class="indent">I hope you will not consider me an
intruder for stopping a moment in your
"poet's corner" to admire the neatness of
your desk, the sweetness of your poetry, the
beauty of the prospect from your window.
Cherish this love of nature, dear, enjoy all
it gives you, for God made these helps to
charm contemplation, and they strengthen
the noble desire to be or to do all that is
sent for our training &amp; our good. Heaven
be about you my child, is mother's Sunday
prayer.</p>

<p class="indent">Louisa Alcott filled her diary with
letters from her mother, occasionally
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span>
adding in later life annotations of her
own. This letter from her mother when
Louisa was eleven is an example:</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">Louisa lived to see her hope realized
and the dream of many years a beautiful
reality.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 109]</span>
Like most writers, Louisa was moody,
and in her hours of depression and despondency
she looked upon her work as a
failure and herself as a useless drag upon
the family. At such times Marmee invariably
came to the rescue and persuaded
her discouraged daughter to use
the pen she was ready to lay down.
Even in Louisa's childhood, when her only
promise of future literary achievement
were her tragedies and melodramas of
lurid style, little gifts show the mother's
faith and pride in her daughter's work.
So did her letters, of which this is an
example:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">Dear Louisa:</p>

<p class="indent">I sometimes stray about the house and
take a peep into the journal. Your pages
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</span>
lately are blank. I am sure your life has
many fine passages well worth recording,
and to me they are always precious. Anything
like intellectual progress in my children
seems to compensate for much disappointment
&amp; perplexity in my own life. Do
write a little each day, dear, if but a line,
to show me how bravely you begin the
battle, how patiently you wait for the rewards
sure to come when the victory is nobly won.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Ever yrs.</span><br />
Mother.
</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">On her fourteenth birthday the mother
accompanies the gift of a pen with this
little poem:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Oh, may this pen your muse inspire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">When wrapt in pure poetic fire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">To write some sweet, some thrilling verse;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 111]</span>
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">A song of love or sorrow's lay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Or duty's clear but tedious way</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">In brighter hope rehearse.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Oh, let your strain be soft and high,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Of crosses here, of crowns beyond the sky;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Truth guide your pen, inspire your theme,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">And from each note joy's music stream.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="indent">Louisa Alcott owed much to her
mother's example and perhaps even more
to her mother's influence. This letter,
carefully preserved in the daughter's
journal, reveals a wealth of mother-love
and of God-given wisdom:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="indent">Accept this pen from your mother
and for her sake use it freely &amp; worthily that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 112]</span>
each day of this your fifteenth year may
testify to some good word or thought or work.</p>

<p class="indent">I know there will be born into your spirit
new hopes, new gifts, for God helps the loving,

your soul to meet the highest, for that alone

<p class="indent">Your temperament is a peculiar one, &amp;
there are few who can really help you. Set

Deeds, not words, characterized Elizabeth
Alcott, as readers of "Little
Women" will recall. She was about
seven when she sent this letter, one of
the very few she wrote, to her mother:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">May, Friday 29.</p>

<p>Dear Mother,</p>

<p class="indent">I thank you very much for your
note. I will try to write better than I
have done. I have not always had a good
pen. I hope I shall improve in all my
studies this summer. I hope I can read
German &amp; French very well, and know a
great deal about the countries. I must
write my journal now so I will bid you
good bye.</p>

<p class="right">
From your loving<br />
Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 114]</span>
Birthdays were always celebrated with
much rejoicing in the Alcott household,
the gift made secondary to the spirit of
the day. From the time they were old
enough to print, the Alcott children on
the mother's birthday made her some
little gift, accompanying it with a note.
Abba May or May, as she was always
called, at nine years old, began in prose
but lapsed into poetry:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Dear Mother,</p>

<p class="indent">I wish you a very happy
birthday. I hope you will find
my present Useful, and when you wear it
think of me. I have taken a great-deal
of Pleasure in making it for you.
Please take this Present mother
on your 49 birthday</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>With the dearest Love and wishes<br />
of your little daughter A.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">With Mrs. Alcott, hardship, poverty,
the grief of seeing her husband misunderstood
and often scoffed at, never lessened
her love for him, or her contentment in
the marriage relation. The year following
her marriage in a letter to her
brother she wrote: "My father has
never married a daughter or son more
completely happy than I am. I have
cares, and soon they will be arduous ones,
but with the mild, constant, and affectionate
sympathy and aid of my husband,
with the increasing health and
loveliness of my quiet and bright little
Anna, with good health, clear head,
grateful heart and ready hand,&mdash;what
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 116]</span>
can I not do when surrounded by influences
like this?"</p>

<p class="indent">Ideals were never shattered; illusions,
if so they may be called, were never lost
by Mrs. Alcott through the stormy years
that laid between the first happy months
of her married life and the sunset days
when all her burdens were laid down.
To her, the husband who was so long
denied material success and intellectual
sympathy ever remained the lover and
friend. Her admiration for him was
unbounded, her faith in him complete.
So high she held him in heart and mind,
that it was difficult even for those who
loved him most to appreciate her estimate
of him as Poet, Philosopher, and
Sage.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 117]</span>
Concerning the most famous portrait
ever made of Bronson Alcott, done in
crayons by Mrs. Richard Hildredth, wife
of the historian and aunt of the portrait
painter, George Fuller, which, beautiful
as it was, did not satisfy the wife's ideal,
Mrs. Alcott writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">
A tinge of the incomprehensible lies
softly around it, a field of atmosphere,
as if she had worked with down from an
angel's wing rather than with a crayon,&mdash;as
if the moonlight had cast a shadow on
the lights of her picture, and a divinity had
touched with a soft shade, the dark portion
of the figure. Mrs. Hildredth has changed
the costume from a dress suit to a mantle
draped about the shoulders. This, I do
not like. The chaste simplicity of Mr.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 118]</span>
Alcott's dress is more in character and
keeping with the severe simplicity and
rectitude of his life. Louisa admirably describes
her father's appearance as she met
him at the cars. "His dress was neat and
poor. He looked cold and thin as an icicle,
but serene as God." After such a testimony,
from such a daughter, he can afford to dress
shabbily.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Contentment, whatever her lot, was
an attribute of Marmee; she underestimated
herself always. Unquestionably,
Louisa inherited her literary gift
quite as much from mother as from
father, and flashes of the quaint humor
so delightful in the daughter's books are
found in the mother's letters. To a friend
she writes: "My gifts are few. I live,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 119]</span>
love and learn, and find myself more content
every day of my life with humble
conditions."</p>

<p class="indent">Louisa Alcott never laid claim to
poetic gift, but on a few occasions her
verses take to themselves true poetic
beauty. One of the most exquisite of
these poems was written by her on the
death of her mother, and was first published
anonymously in the "Masque of
Poets" of 1878:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Children's Diaries</span></h3>

<p class="cap">THE Alcott children were brought
up to think for themselves, to
reflect, and to give expression to
their thoughts. Never laughed at, they
were not afraid to speak or write of
what was in their minds. Each kept a
diary, and no incident that concerned
the little girls was too trivial for mention
in the record of the day. These incidents,
collected, give a more comprehensive
view of the Alcotts as a family
than do the father's voluminous journals.</p>

When Anna was ten, she gravely explains
under date of April 13, 1841:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">Father was too unwell to come down
stairs and mother ironed, Louisa and I
helped a little while. I wrote my journal and
a journal for Louisa as she thought she
could not write well enough. I had no other
lessons than that. We watched a little spider
and gave it some water to drink. In the
afternoon mother read loud the story of
the good aunt or part of it while we sewed
on the clean clothes I mended up the holes
and Louisa and Lizzy sewed on a sheet. In
the evening we played mother lets us play
in the evening. We went to bed soon.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">This sewing bee recalls the long evenings
in the March home, described in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 124]</span>
"Little Women," when the four girls
and the mother sewed dutifully on sheets
for Aunt March, dividing seams into
countries, discussing Europe, Asia,
Africa, and America as they stitched.</p>

<p class="indent">When she was twelve, Anna's literary
aspirations sought a vent in attempted
poetry. Later she collaborated with
Louisa in writing the "Comic Tragedies."
Anna's confidante and comrade, Louisa,
was frequently the victim of these poetic
effusions, her reception of which gives
quite a line on her ardent temperament.
This entry in Anna's journal for April
23, 1843, is eloquent:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">This morning I rose pretty early&mdash;After
breakfast I read and wrote stories. In the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 125]</span>
afternoon I wrote some letters and the following
one to Louisa:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Louisa dear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">With love sincere</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Accept this little gift from me</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">It is with pleasure</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">I send this treasure</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">And with it send much love to thee.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 7em;">Sister dear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Never fear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">God will help you if you try.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Do not despair</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">But always care</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">To be good and love to try.</span></p>

<p class="indent">In the evening I read in a book called
'Stories on the Lord's-prayer.' I talked
with Louisa after I went to bed and she
pinched me on my leg.</p>
</div><p class="indent"></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 126]</span>
Two or three years later Anna writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Monday.<br />
</p>

<p class="indent">Mother went to Boston and Louisa and
I cleaned house all day. I love order above
all things and I take great pleasure in seeing
all neat about the house.</p>

<p>Tuesday.</p>

<p class="indent">I worked hard till 2 o'clock when we all
met to sew while mother read aloud from
"Miss Bremers Brothers and Sister's." It
is most beautiful such a happy family. I
think Miss Bremer would make a lovely
mother the mothers in her books are so sweet
and she has beautiful idear's about family's.
I love to read natural stories.</p>

<p>Wednesday 30th.</p>

<p class="indent">We rose very early and eat breakfast. I
think it is a dreadful thing to grow old and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 127]</span>
not be able to fly about, but then I suppose
I shall not care about flying when I grow
older, still it is horrid to think about being
an old woman all wrinkled and blind. I wish
I could keep young forever. I should love
to live among all those I love and be with
them all the time.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Reading was a part of the daily routine
in the Alcott household, and Anna's
taste for German recalls vividly certain
episodes between Meg and John Brooks
in "Little Women."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Friday 18th.</p>

<p class="indent">I read one of Krummacher's parables
in German. I think they are very beautiful,
the language is so elegant. I love to hear
beautiful words and these stories are told so
simply and are full of such sweet thought.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span>
I found a great many which have never been
translated and I intend to try myself to
translate them. I think it is the pleasantest
thing I do to read German. It is such a
splendid language. I mean Elizabeth shall
learn to read it, she will enjoy it so much.</p>

<p>Saturday 19th.</p>

<p class="indent">In the afternoon I sewed and Louisa
read me a very silly story called 'The Golden
Cup.' I think there is a great deal of
nonsense written now a days, the papers are
full of silly stories.</p>

<p>Sunday 20th.</p>

<p class="indent">I have been reading lately a very beautiful
book given me by my mother. It is "Characteristics
of Women" by Mrs. Jameson. I
like it very much. It is a description of
Shakespear's Heroines, Portia is my favorite,
she was so noble and I liked the Trial scene
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 129]</span>
better than any of Shakespears that I ever
read. I think this part is beautiful.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">'Let music sound while he doth make his choice;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Then if he love he make a swan like end</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Fading in music.'</span><br />
</p>

<p class="indent">I think this was a beautiful idea.</p>

<p class="indent">I passed a pleasant morning in school,
translating one of Krummacher's beautiful
parables. I find great pleasure in this. I
like German better than I do French. I
want much to study Italian. I have tried
myself several times but cannot manage it
without help. I think I should be very
happy if I could go to school. I think about
it most all the time and when I am in bed I
imagine myself in Boston going to Miss
Peabody's school with other girls and know
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 130]</span>
that I am learning something. And I think
I lead rather too solitary a life. I love to see
people. Mother read in the afternoon from
Miss Sedgwick's Letters. It was about
the Germans. She says they are a very
cheerful people and though poor yet they
always have a happy smile and cheerful face.
That their manners are beautiful. They
are so kind and simple. I know I should
love them, for I like everything German,
except their food, which I think must be
horrid, greasy cabbage and sour bread.
That seems bad. I should think they are so
fond of beautiful things; music, poetry and
flowers, that they would not like such stuff.</p>

<p>
September, 1845.<br />
Friday 1st.
</p>

<p class="indent">I walked before breakfast, the sun was
bright and there was a cool wind. The
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 131]</span>
lane was full of beautiful flowers and the grass
was green and fresh. I had a lovely walk
and gathered a bunch of goldenrod, spirian
and gerandia. Everything was so beautiful
that all my unhappy thoughts of last night
flew away. I sometimes have strange feelings,
a sort of longing after something I
don't know what it is. I have a great many
wishes. I spent the day in the usual manner,
sewing and studying. In the evening Louisa
and I walked through the lane and talked
about how we should like to live and
dress and imagined all kinds of beautiful
things.</p>

<p class="indent">
Sunday 3rd.<br />
</p>

<p class="indent">I sewed all day and mother read from
"Miss Sedgwick's Letters." I will write a
piece of poetry, as I have nothing very
pleasant to write about:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">
"Oh when thy heart is full of fears</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">
And the way is dim to Heaven</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">
When the sorrow and the sin of years</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">
Peace from thy soul has driven</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">
Then through the mist of falling tears</span><br />

Look up and be forgiven.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">

<span style="margin-left: 8em;">
Let Virtue o'er thy appetites</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">
Have full and perfect mastery</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">
And the kindly ones that hover o'er</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">
Will ever strengthen thee.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">
"And though thou art helpless and forlorn</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">
Let not thy heart's peace go</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">
And though the riches of this world are gone</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">
And thy lot is care and woe</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">
Faint not, but journey ever on</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">
True wealth is not below.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">
"Oh, falter not but still look up</span><br />

</p>

<p class="indent">Louisa composed these lines, which I
think are beautiful. She is a beautiful girl
and writes as good poetry as Lucretia Davidson,
about whom so much has been written.
I think she will write <span class="u">something great one
of these days</span>. As for me I am perfect in
nothing. I have no genius. I know a little
of music, a little of French, German and
Drawing, but none of them well. I have a
foolish wish to be something <span class="u">great</span> and I
shall probably spend my life in a kitchen
and die in the poor-house. I want to be
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 134]</span>
Jenny Lind or Mrs. Seguin and I can't and
so I cry. Here is another of Louisa's pieces
to mother.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">
"God comfort thee dear mother,</span><br />

</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Helpfulness was encouraged in the
Alcott household; habits of industry
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 135]</span>
were carefully fostered. The Alcott children
worked when they worked, played
when they played, but wasted hours
were unknown. They were taught to
make the most of every day. When
Anna was seventeen she wrote in her
diary:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="indent">Lizzy and I are making plans for spending
our days usefully. Here is mine.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">Hear Lizzy recite German and French till
6. Supper.</p>

<p class="indent">This will keep me pretty busy, but I find
I accomplish so much more when I have a
plan and certain times for certain things.
I never can do things without order. I like
to have something planned for every moment
of the day, so that when I get up in the morning
I may know what to do. I wish I could
be learned.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">An entry in Louisa's diary during the
Fruitlands period gives this insight into
one of her average days, when a child of
eleven:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">I rose at five, and after breakfast washed
the dishes and then helped mother work. I
took care of May in the afternoon. In the
evening I made some pretty things for my
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 137]</span>
dolly. Father and Mr. Lane had a talk and
father asked us if we saw any reason for
us to separate. Mother wanted to, she is
so tired. I like it, but not the school part
or Mr. L.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Note, too, that when it came to a
conference concerning family affairs, the
father asked the advice of his eleven-year-old
daughter, instead of following
the more customary method of withholding
from her the family confidence
and deferring discussion of plans until
the children had gone to bed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Know Thyself," was ever the aim of
Bronson Alcott in the training of his
children, and Mr. Lane at Fruitlands
followed this same line of mental development.
This is one of his sample
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 138]</span>
lessons which Louisa Alcott has copied
into her journal:</p>

Louisa's love of nature, her trained
habits of thought, her poetic imagination,
and her keen appreciation of beauty
are indicated in this entry in her journal,
written at Fruitlands in 1843 or 1844,
when she was a child of ten or eleven:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">I wrote in my imagination book, and
enjoyed it very much. Life is pleasanter
than it used to be, and I don't care about
dying any more. Had a splendid run, and
got a box of cones to burn. Sat and heard
the pines sing a long time. Had good dreams,
and woke now and then to think, and watch
the moon. I had a pleasant time with my
mind, for it was happy.</p>

"Little Women" is the March
family's quaint brown house with
its many windows, its old-fashioned garden,
its homely, homelike air, its unfailing
hospitality. This home, as described by
Louisa M. Alcott, is a picture of the
Alcott home at Concord, the scene of
the girlhood and young womanhood of
the Alcott children. Many of Louisa's
books were written there; "Little
Women" was lived there. In Concord,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 141]</span>
Anna met John Pratt, and the first love
story in "Little Women" is Anna's life
romance. There little Beth passed from
the material to the spiritual life, and
Amy first developed the artistic talents
which later caused her work to be sought
for by art museums and private collectors.</p>

<p class="indent">Anna's marriage was a great trial to
Louisa, for from early childhood the two
girls had been inseparable companions,
and after Anna's marriage Louisa learned
to look upon John as her brother.</p>

<p class="indent">Louisa's diary in the April following
the passing of Elizabeth touches upon
the change of homes in Concord, the
absence of May, who was studying art
in Boston, of Elizabeth and of Anna:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p class="center">April.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">Came to occupy one wing of Hawthorne's
house (once ours) while the new one was
being repaired. Father, mother and I kept
house together, May being in Boston, Anna
at Pratt farm, &amp; for the first time Lizzy
absent. I don't miss her as I expected to do,
for she seems nearer &amp; dearer than before,
&amp; I am glad to know she is safe from pain &amp;
age in some world where her innocent soul
must be happy.</p>

<p class="indent">Death never seemed terrible to me, &amp; now
is beautiful, so I cannot fear it, but find it
friendly and wonderful.</p>

<p class="indent">Amy's artistic efforts and her failures
in "Little Women" are taken from May's
actual experiences in Concord. Turning
the career of the youngest of the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 143]</span>
Alcott girls into a romance earlier in
"Little Women" than it actually
occurred in life, doubtless prevented
Louisa Alcott from chronicling the artistic
success of her youngest sister, a success
to which she largely contributed
and in which she took great pride.</p>

<p class="indent">May Alcott's pictures are found to-day
in art museums and in leading private
collections in this country and
abroad. Her copies of Turner are remarkable.
In the Kensington Gallery
in London students are given them to
study in preference to the originals.
Several fine examples are in American
museums, and a few are owned by members
of the Alcott family.</p>

<p class="indent">When the Alcotts moved into Orchard
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 144]</span>
House, the girls painted and papered
the interior themselves. May filled the
nooks and corners with panels, on which
she painted birds and flowers. Over the
fireplaces she inscribed mottoes in Old
English characters.</p>

<p class="indent">The study in Orchard House was the
real center of the household. For the
chimney piece Ellery Channing wrote an
epigram, which May Alcott painted upon
it, and which has been used in the stage
reproduction of "Little Women":</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">"The Hills are reared, the Valleys scooped in vain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">If Learning's Altars vanish from the Plain."</span></p>
</div>

<p class="indent">In Orchard House to-day, walls, doors,
and window casings are etched with May
Alcott's drawings, many preserved under
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 145]</span>
glass, including a miniature portrait of
a little girl, naïvely and modestly inscribed
"The Artist."</p>

<p class="indent">High thoughts and cheerful minds
triumphed over poverty in those Concord
days. Shortly after the family's return
from Fruitlands, Louisa wrote for Ellen
Emerson the fairy stories, "Flower
Fables." She was at the time only
sixteen. This was her earliest published
work, and it was many years before she
achieved literary fame, although, as did
Jo in "Little Women," she materially
helped in the support of the family by
writing lurid tales.</p>

<p class="indent">Literature rather than commerce freed
the Alcotts from the burden of debt.
Louisa's fame was the result, neither of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 146]</span>
accident, nor of a single achievement,
but had for its background the whole
generous past of her family. Her "Hospital
Sketches" were her letters home,
when she was serving as hospital nurse
during the Civil War. "Little Women"
is a chronicle of her family. Louisa
certainly made good use of the vicissitudes
of the Alcotts. She always saw
the funny side and was not afraid to
make book material of the home experiences,
elevating or humiliating. Her
books number between twenty-five and
thirty. Nearly every one takes its basic
idea from some real experience. The
books written by the Alcott family,
including some eight or ten published by
Mr. Alcott, Louisa's output, and one or
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 147]</span>
two written by May, fill two shelves of
an alcove devoted to Concord authors
in the Alcott town library.</p>

<p class="indent">Anna's little sons, familiarly known
in the Alcott household as Freddie and
Johnnie, or Jack, gave to Bronson Alcott
in his later days fresh opportunity for
his favorite study&mdash;childhood. To
both boys came frequent messages and
gifts from Grandpa, Grandma, and Aunt
Louisa.</p>

<p class="indent">Louisa Alcott sent to Freddie this poem
on his third birthday:</p>

<p class="indent">In these days of private secretaries,
labor-saving devices, and specialization,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 157]</span>
it is difficult to comprehend the obstacles
that Louisa Alcott encountered in writing.
Her day was filled with other
tasks, housework, sewing, teaching,
nursing&mdash;yet the pen was never idle,
the busy brain was never still. Her
power of concentration made it possible
for her to write under harassing conditions.
This is her own description of
her methods of work:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">My methods of work are very simple and
soon told. My head is my study, and there
I keep the various plans of stories for years
sometimes, letting them grow as they will
till I am ready to put them on paper. Then
it is quick work, as chapters go down word
for word as they stand in my mind, and need
no alteration. I never copy, since I find by
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 158]</span>
experience that the work I spend the least
time upon is best liked by critics and speakers.</p>

<p class="indent">Any paper, any pen, any place that is
quiet suit me, and I used to write from
morning till night without fatigue when
"the steam was up." Now, however, I am
paying the penalty of twenty years of over
work, and can write but two hours a day,
doing about twenty pages, sometimes more,
though my right thumb is useless from
writer's cramp.</p>

<p class="indent">While a story is under way I live in it,
see the people more plainly than real ones
around me, hear them talk, and am much
interested, surprised and provoked at their
actions, for I seem to have no power to rule
them, and can simply record their experiences
and performances.</p>

<p class="indent">Materials for the children's tales I find
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 159]</span>
in the lives of the little people about me, for
no one can invent anything so droll, pretty
or pathetic as the sayings and doings of these
small actors, poets and martyrs. In the
older books, the events are mostly from real
life, the strongest the truest, and I yet hope to
write a few of the novels which have been
simmering in my brain while necessity and
unexpected success have confined me to
juvenile literature.</p>

<p class="indent">I gave Mrs. Moulton many facts for her
article in "Famous Women," and there are
many other sketches which will add more if
they are wanted. The first edition of
"Jo's Boys" was twenty thousand I believe,
and over fifty thousand were soon gone.
Since January I know little about the sales.
People usually ask "How much have you
made?" I am contented with a hundred
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 160]</span>
thousand, and find my best success in the
comfort my family enjoy; also a naughty
satisfaction in proving that it was better
<i>not</i> to "stick to teaching" as advised, but to
write.</p>

<p class="indent">With all her love for her father, irreverent
Louisa delighted in making fun of
him. The complacent philosopher, with
his voluminous journals, his several books
in manuscript, his liking, despite the
brilliancy of his conversations, for the
written rather than the spoken word,
was a wasteful user of paper and a careless
dispenser of ink. That her father
enjoyed her good-natured banter is shown
by the fact that in his journal he has
entered the following poem, written by
Louisa at nineteen:</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Friendships and Beliefs</span></h3>

<p class="cap">RARE friendships existed among the
great minds of that period, when
Transcendentalism in America was
first talked and lived, a close bond of
sympathy uniting Bronson Alcott, Emerson,
Thoreau, Ellery Channing, Margaret
Fuller, and Elizabeth Peabody.
Such association made its impress upon
the Alcott daughters. Anna's diary is
filled with references to visits with the
Emersons. Louisa's deal less with the
family and more with the intellectual
life of the great philosopher, whom she
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 163]</span>
made her idol. Through life he was her
stanch and understanding friend.</p>

<p class="indent">"The Apostles of the Newness" was
the scoffing term applied to these literary
giants of New England by those who
lacked the mental and spiritual insight
to recognize greatness in others.</p>

<p class="indent">This attitude of ridicule was largely
responsible for the continued attacks
upon the <i>Dial</i>, a quarterly issued by
the Transcendentalists, edited from 1840
to 1844 by Emerson, Margaret Fuller,
George Ripley, and Thoreau. Between
its modest covers were many of the intellectual
masterpieces of the time: its
rare volumes are still treasure-houses of
literature which to-day command any
price. Mr. Alcott selected its title and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 164]</span>
was to a large extent responsible for its
policy. His Orphic Sayings in the <i>Dial</i>,
now looked upon as classics, were the
butt of the press at the time, and the
derision of Boston society.</p>

<p class="indent">In these Orphic Sayings, he gave this
remarkable definition of Reform: "Reforms
are the noblest of facts. Extant
in time, they work for eternity: dwelling
with men, they are with God."</p>

<p class="indent">Conversation among these friends was
neither trivial nor useless, and in the
Alcott circle, which included Emerson,
Thoreau, Theodore Parker, William
Henry Channing, James Freeman Clarke,
Elizabeth Peabody, Mrs. Cheney, and
other of the early Transcendentalists,
later on augmented by James Russell
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 165]</span>
Lowell and Nathaniel Hawthorne, a series
of drawing-room symposiums was established,
with Alcott, whom Emerson called
"serious and superior," as a leader.
Much of the substance of these conversations
is found in the Alcott journals,
and in the unpublished manuscripts of
the poet-philosopher.</p>

<p class="indent">In Concord, the Alcotts once more
enjoyed the literary companionship they
craved. Emerson was a near neighbor.
Thoreau had his cabin at Walden, where
he had established "a community of
one." To and from Boston came others
of the Transcendental group, and Concord
became the center of thought for New
England.</p>

<p class="indent">Thinking, however, was not the only
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 166]</span>
occupation of Bronson Alcott. Dreamer
he was, but he delighted in toil and ever
upheld the dignity of labor, not ashamed
nor afraid to work for hire as a laborer
in his neighbor's field, while nightly
conducting drawing-room conversations
with a company of peers and students.</p>

<p class="indent">When Thoreau built his cabin, Alcott
helped him. They cut the trees from
Emerson's grove. While Emerson was
abroad, they built a summer-house for
him on his grounds. It stood for many
years, a picturesque temple of friendship.
William Henry Channing mentions a
morning spent there, reading Margaret
Fuller's Italian letters. May Alcott has
made drawings of it, which were published
in a volume of "Concord Sketches"
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 167]</span>
that also contained her drawing of Hawthorne's
house.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Alcott practically rebuilt Orchard
House for his own family. Mrs. Child,
a friend of Mrs. Alcott, thus describes
this home, which is now preserved as a
memorial to Louisa M. Alcott and is
visited by thousands every year:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">When they bought the place the house
was so very old that it was thrown into the
bargain, with the supposition that it was fit
for nothing but firewood. But Mr. Alcott
had an architectural taste, more intelligible
than his Orphic Sayings. He let every old
rafter and beam stay in its place, changed
old ovens and ash holes into Saxon arched
alcoves, and added a washerwoman's old
shanty to the rear. The result is a house
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 168]</span>
full of queer nooks and corners, with all
manner of juttings in and out. It seems as
if the spirit of some old architect had dropped
it down in Concord.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Thoreau, master builder himself, has
paid to Bronson Alcott this tribute:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">One of the last of the philosophers, Connecticut
gave him to the world. He peddled
first her wares, afterwards, as he declares,
his brains. These he peddles still, bearing
for fruit, only his brain, like the nut its kernel.
His words and attitude always suppose
a better state of things than other men are
aquainted with, and he will be the last man
to be disappointed when the ages revolve.
He has no venture in the present. But
though comparatively disregarded now,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 169]</span>
when his day comes, laws unsuspected by
most will take effect, and rulers will come to
him for advice.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Emerson, who saw the boy mind beneath
the philosopher's dignity, said
tenderly of Bronson Alcott: "He is
certainly the youngest man of his age
we have seen. When I looked at his
gray hairs, his conversation sounded
pathetic; but I looked again and they
reminded me of the gray dawn."</p>

<p class="indent">Even his friends, to say nothing of
Louisa, occasionally poked fun at him
for chronicling so minutely all his
thoughts. Ellery Channing called his
library, "Encyclopediea de Moi-meme,
en cents volumes." Yet these journals
and records are now worth more than the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 170]</span>
fine library he collected and in which he
delighted.</p>

<p class="indent">Emerson has thus described the origin
of the Fruitlands community:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">On the invitation of James P. Greaves
of London, the friend and fellow-laborer of
Pestalozzi in Switzerland, Mr. Alcott went
to England in 1842. Mr. Greaves died
before his arrival, but Mr. Alcott was received
cordially by his friends, who had
given his name to their school, Alcott House,
Ham, near London. He spent several
months in making acquaintance with various
classes of reformers. On his return to
America, he brought with him two of his
English friends, Chas. Lane and H. C.
Wright; and Mr. Lane having bought a farm
which he called Fruitlands, at Harvard,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 171]</span>
Mass., they all went there to found a new
community.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The Fruitlands experiment and its
failure have been immortalized by Louisa
Alcott in her "Transcendental Wild
Oats." The detail of it is thus described
by a friend of the Alcott family,
who had the story from Bronson Alcott
himself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">The crop failures necessitated the community
living on a barley diet, as anything
animal was not allowed, not even milk and
eggs. Now and then they gave a thought
as to what they should do for shoes when
those they had were gone; for depriving the
cow of her skin was a crime not to be tolerated.
The barley crop was injured in harvesting,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 172]</span>
and before long want was staring them in
the face. The Alcotts remained at Fruitlands
till mid-winter in dire poverty, all the
guests having taken their departure as provisions
vanished. Friends came to the rescue,
and, Mr. Alcott concluded with pathos in his
voice, "We put our little women on an ox-sled
and made our way to Concord! So
faded one of the dreams of my youth. I
have given you the facts as they were;
Louisa has given the comic side in 'Transcendental
Wild Oats'; but Mrs. Alcott could
give you the tragic side."</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Indeed, it was always Mrs. Alcott who
could have given the tragic side, skillfully
as she kept her worries hidden. Her
own family, indignant because Bronson
Alcott could not better provide the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 173]</span>
material needs for his family, on more
than one occasion besought the faithful
wife to leave him.</p>

<p class="indent">A letter from her brother, urging this
step, drew forth from her a defense of
Bronson Alcott which the husband enters
in his journal as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
November<br />
1840</p>

<p class="indent">Passages of a letter from my wife to one
who misapprehends and perverts my life
and purposes.</p>

<p class="indent">"If I do not mistake the spirit as well as
letter of your remark you would have us
believe that a righteous retribution has
overtaken us, (or my husband, and we are
one,) and that the world is justly punishing
him for not having conciliated it, by conforming
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 174]</span>
to its wills and ways.&mdash;You say that
my husband was told ten years ago, that the
world could not understand him. It perhaps
fell dead on his ears and ever will.
There is no human voice can convince him
that the path he has chosen to tread, thorny,
bleak, solitary, as it is, is not the right one
for him. Just so did that man of Nazareth
whom all the world profess to admire and
adore, but few to imitate; and these few
are the laughing-stock of the Christian
Community. They are branded as visionaries
and fools. But this little band when
alone and disencumbered of idle observation,
enjoy the recital of their privations; they
have been reviled, but they revile not again;
they know sorrow and are acquainted with
grief; and yet there is joy in that group of
sinless men, such as angels might desire to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 175]</span>
partake of. I am not writing poetry, but I
have tried to place before your mind, in as
brief, but clear a manner as I am able, our
real condition, and Mr. Alcott's merit as a
man, who, though punished and neglected
by a wicked world, has much to console and
encourage him in the confidence and cooperation
of some of the wisest and best men
living. Ten such, were they permitted in
their several vocations to act as teachers,
preachers, and printers, would save our
wicked city from the ruin that awaits it.
But they are turned, like the Nazarene, into
solitary places to lament the blindness and
folly of mankind, who are following the vain
and fleeting shadow for the real and abiding
substance. But to return to Mr. Alcott, is
he to sell his soul, or what is the same thing,
his principles, for the bread that perisheth?
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 176]</span>
No one will employ him in his way; he cannot
work in theirs, if he thereby involve his
conscience. He is so resolved in this matter
that I believe he will starve and freeze before
he will sacrifice principle to comfort. In this,
I and my children are necessarily implicated:
we make and mean to make all the sacrifices
we can to sustain him, but we have less to
sustain us in the spirit, and therefore, are
more liable to be overcome of the flesh.
He has, for a long time gone without everything
which he could not produce by labor,
from his own place, that no one could in
truth reproach him with wantonly eating
of the fruits of another's labor.</p>

<p class="indent">He was sent for by friends in Hingham to
talk with them; which he did two evenings;
his expenses were paid and $23. put into his
hands as a slight compensation for the benefit
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 177]</span>
they felt he had conferred upon them by his
conversations. I should like to copy the
note accompanying it, but you never care
to see how his fellow fanatics rave on these
holy themes, life, duty, destiny of man.
Thus he occasionally finds a market for his
thoughts and experiences, which, though
inadequate to our support, is richly prized
as the honest gains of an innocent and
righteous labor. You spoke of his "poetical
wardrobe" whether in satire or in a worthier
spirit, I cannot tell. However spiritual
he may have become, there is still enough of
the carnal to feel the chills of winter, and
the chiller blasts of satire. His tatters are
the rags of righteousness and keep him
warmer than they would anyone whose
spirit was less cheered and warmed by the
fires of eternal love and truth.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 178]</span>
An appreciative account of Mr. Alcott's
famous school in the Masonic Temple,
Boston, is found in the "Record of a
School," edited by Elizabeth Peabody,
published in 1835, republished in 1874.
The "Conversations with Children on
the Gospels," edited by Mr. Alcott in
two volumes, appearing in 1836-1837,
caused such a commotion in Boston as
to result in the downfall of the Temple
School. Reading these conversations
to-day, one is impressed with the modern
quality of their thought. They were
forerunners of that higher criticism,
which with the Bible student now supplants
the old blind acceptance without
reflection of even obscure Biblical passages.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 179]</span>
On philosophy and religion Mr. Alcott
and Miss Peabody delighted to talk and
write. Their discussion of the existence
of evil is startlingly modern.</p>

<p class="indent">"I do not think that evil should be
clothed in form by the imagination,"
writes Miss Peabody to Mr. Alcott;
"I think every effort should be made to
strip it of all individuality, all shaping
and all coloring. And the reason is,
that Evil has in truth no substantial
existence, that it acquires all the existence
it has from want of faith and soul cultivation,
and that this is sufficient reason
why all cultivation should be directed
to give positiveness, coloring, shaping,
to all kinds of good&mdash;Good only being
eternal truth."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 180]</span>
In reply, the philosopher thus comments
in his diary: "Evil has no positive
existence, I agree with Miss Peabody,
but it has usurped a positive place
and being in the popular imagination,
and by the imagination must it be made
to flee away into its negative life. How
shall this be done? By shadowing forth
in vivid colors the absolute beauty and
phenomena of good, by assuming evil
not as positive, but as negative."</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall always love you for loving
Alcott," writes Emerson to his schoolmate
and lifelong friend, the Reverend
W. H. Furness. "He is a great man,
the god with the herdsman of Admetus.
His conversation is sublime; yet when
I see how he is underestimated by cultivated
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 181]</span>
people, I fancy none but I have
heard him talk."</p>

<p class="indent">In the midst of slander and petty persecutions,
Alcott writes in his diary for
April, 1837:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">I have been striving to apprehend the
real in the seeming, to strip ideas of their
adventitious phrases and behold them in
their order and powers. I have sought to
penetrate the showy terrestrial to find the
heavenly things. I have tried to translate
into ideas the language and images of spirit,
and thus to read God in his works. The
outward I have seen as the visage and type
of the inward. Ever doth this same nature
double its design and stand forth&mdash;now
before the inner, now before the outer sense
of man, at once substance and form, image
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 182]</span>
and idea, so that God shall never slip wholly
from the consciousness of the soul.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Emerson, weary of seeing his friend
misunderstood, urges him to give up
teaching and become an author, picturing
as his golden view for Alcott that
one day he will leave the impracticable
world to wag its own way, sit apart, and
write his oracles for its behoof.</p>

<p class="indent">"Write! let them hear or let them
forbear," he thunders. "The written
word abides until, slowly and unexpectedly,
and in widely sundered places,
it has created its own church."</p>

<p class="indent">The unreality of evil, as taught and
believed by Alcott nearly a century ago,
laughed and scoffed at then, was twenty-five
years later practically the foundation
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 183]</span>
of a belief which gained its first
foothold in New England, and, with
headquarters in Boston, has spread, until
to-day its followers and churches circle
the civilized globe&mdash;a new-old religion,
based on the literal acceptance of the
teachings of Christ. What to-day is
called metaphysical teaching was in the
Alcott period scoffed at as Transcendentalism.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Alcott's strict adherence to a
vegetarian diet was also the topic of
ridicule from public and press, although
the Alcott children seemed to thrive on it,
and certainly, as four-year-old Louisa
once remarked, "Did pitty well for a
wegetable diet."</p>

<p class="indent">Louisa, in her journal, gives this sample
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 184]</span>
of the vegetarian wafers they had at
Fruitlands:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="indent">Bronson Alcott constantly sought self-improvement,
and the shortcomings of
his early education were more than offset
by his untiring study. Realizing at one
time his lack of a vocabulary, he comments
in his journal, that to rectify this
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 185]</span>
he has just bought two books, "A Symposium
of Melancholy," and "Hunter
on the Blood."</p>

<p class="indent">In their memoirs of Bronson Alcott,
F. B. Sanborn and W. T. Harris have
thus summed up his character: "He was
the most filial son, the most faithful
lover, the most attached friend, the
most generous philanthropist of his time.
And when he died, he left fewer enemies
than any man of equal age can have
provoked or encountered in so long a
career."</p>

<p class="indent">In his study of childhood, Mr. Alcott
sought first to reach the mind, recognizing
that as "the God within us." He
encouraged individuality in his children,
trying in their earliest years to make
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 186]</span>
them think for themselves. All through
his teaching runs the boy's friendship
with God, and his sense of oneness with
his Maker was a part of the divine heritage
he passed on to his daughters.</p>

<p class="indent">He records in his diary a conversation
with Anna, who was four, and Louisa,
who was two, after reading to them the
story of Jesus, which he made so vital
that, given their choice, they asked for
it in preference to a fairy tale. Anna
remarked that Jesus did not really die.
"They killed his body, but not his soul."
Her father asked: "What is the soul,
Anna?" The little four-year-old replied:
"It's this inside of me that
makes me feel and think and love."
"And," said the father, "what became of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 187]</span>
Jesus' soul?" Anna replied: "It went
back to God." Whereat little two-year-old
Louisa asked: "Why, isn't Dod
inside of me?"</p>

<p class="indent">A note in the father's diary at the
birth of Elizabeth records "Anna's first
interview with her sister" (Elizabeth a
few hours old), and a day later comes
this record: "Anna and Louisa interview
their sister." Louisa, two years
old, wishes to have the baby sister put
in her arms, when four-year-old Anna
says warningly: "Treat her very carefully,
Louisa, she comes from God."
What a beautiful thought to give a child
of the divine mystery of birth!</p>

<p class="indent">Instead of asserting what he intended
to make of his children, Alcott encouraged
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 188]</span>
the child to make itself, beginning
when it was a small baby, treating it as
an individual, giving it opportunity to
use its mentality, instilling principles of
right and wrong by suggestion. Alcott
never commanded. "You don't wish
to do that," was his way, not exacting
blind obedience, but expressing his conviction
that the child wished to do right.</p>

<p class="indent">To him, God was love. He had no
fear of God, for perfect love had cast out
fear. This same spirit was manifested
in all his children. To them the change
called Death was not to be dreaded;
it was a stepping forward and upward.</p>

<p class="indent">This thought that death is not the
end, but the beginning, is expressed in
one of Louisa's most beautiful poems:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 189]</span></p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Thoreau's Flute</span></h3>

<p><span style="margin-left: 8em;">We sighing said, "Our Pan is dead;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">His pipe hangs mute beside the river.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Around it wistful sunbeams quiver,</span><br />

<p><span style="margin-left: 8em;">Then from the flute, untouched by hands,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">There came a low, harmonious breath;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"For such as he there is no death&mdash;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Seek not for him&mdash;he is with thee."</span>
</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">A visit to Sleepy Hollow suggests life,
not death. Giant trees stretch their
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 191]</span>
branches over marble and granite monuments,
as if in benediction. "There is
no death, for God is life," they seem to
say. For them there is no death. Emerson
lives to-day, the great philosopher;
so do Thoreau, Hawthorne, Bronson
Alcott, and others of that mighty company.
And who shall say that Louisa
Alcott is dead? She lives in the hearts
of thousands, and will go on living
through the love they bear her.</p>

<p class="indent">Bronson Alcott was a true disciple of
Jesus Christ. He lived the example
set by his Master not alone in words
and thoughts, but in deeds. He lived
through and beyond misunderstanding,
ridicule, poverty, to see his teachings
respected, his name honored, to see the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 192]</span>
first glimmer of the new light which was
beginning to break over the world, the
sunrise at his own sunset.</p>

<p class="indent">This thought is embodied in the last
poem Louisa Alcott ever wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<h3>Transcriber's Notes:</h3>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Spelling errors, grammatical errors, and typographical errors within
letters were not corrected, in order to preserve the flavor of the
historical record of those letters. After all, some of these letters
were written by girls as young as five.</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the illustrations have been moved so that they do not break up
paragraphs, thus the page number of the illustration might not match the
page number in the List of Illustrations.</p>

<p class="indent">On page 58, "reëstablished" was replaced with "reestablished".</p>

<p class="indent">On page 173, has a quotation mark at the beginning of "If I do not
mistake" but no closing quotation mark, and it is less than clear where
the closing quotation mark should be.</p>

<p class="indent"> In the Chronology, horizontal rules were added to give clarity to the tables.</p>
